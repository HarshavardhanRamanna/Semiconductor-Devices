Before the dawn of time, we had vaccum tubes. Heat metal cathode which emit electrons. These electrons are captured by the anode.
Problems - lot of heating, reliability issues, only one way electron movement, bulky

Enter the transistor. Tiny, reliable, no heating, efficient, can be bipolar which is especially useful in electronic circuits.
Moore's law states that size of transistor halves every year. Fundamental limits reached, physics understanding is important.
